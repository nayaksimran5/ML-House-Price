# House Price Prediction System
## Project Description
The House Price Prediction System is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to predict the sale prices of residential properties based on various features. This project aims to leverage historical data to build a predictive model that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions regarding property transactions.
## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: To explore and analyze the dataset, identifying key features that influence house prices.
- **Data Preprocessing**: To clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Model Development**: To implement and compare various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods.
- **Model Evaluation**: To evaluate the performance of different models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
- **Model Optimization**: To fine-tune the selected model using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
## Data Sources
The dataset used for this project is derived from the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) competition on Kaggle.
